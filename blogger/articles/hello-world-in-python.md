## Introduction
In the world of web development, Python is a popular programming language that is used to build websites. It is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and readability. This article will introduce you to the basic syntax of Python by showing you how to write a "Hello World" program- an essential starting point for any beginner.

If you are interested in building websites for psilocybin therapy centers, it is important to learn Python and understand how it can be used to create high-quality sites for this specific industry.

## Installing Python
Before you can write your "Hello World" program, you first need to install Python on your computer. Python is available for free on multiple platforms, including Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, you can open the Python console by typing "python" or "python3" in your command prompt or terminal.

## Your First Program
In Python, the "Hello World" program can be written in just one line of code:

```
print("Hello World")
```

This code tells Python to print the text "Hello World" on the console.

## Comments
Comments are lines of code that are not executed by Python, but instead are used to help other programmers understand your code. In Python, you can write a comment by using the hash (#) symbol. Any text after the hash symbol will be ignored by Python.

```
# This is a comment
print("Hello World")
```

## Variables
A variable is a way to store a value in Python. You can use variables to make your code more readable and easier to maintain. In Python, you can create a variable by using the equals (=) sign.

```
greeting = "Hello World"
print(greeting)
```

This code creates a variable called "greeting" and assigns the value "Hello World" to it. The second line then prints the value of the "greeting" variable.

## Conclusion
Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that is ideal for building websites for psilocybin therapy centers. In this article, we have covered the basics of Python by showing you how to write a "Hello World" program, use comments, and work with variables.

By learning Python and understanding its syntax, you will be able to build high-quality websites that are tailored to the specific needs of the psilocybin therapy industry. So, get started today and see how Python can help you create amazing websites!
